# Web Guesser
This is part of the intermission week homework between Module 1 and Module 2. The full tutorial can be found [here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html). This project is an introduction to using Sinatra. This implementation does the following:
* Generates a random number on startup
* Has a web page where you can enter a guess
* Tells you whether your guess wasâ€¦
  * Way too high
  * Too high
  * Correct
  * Too low
  * Way too low
* Also indicates via background color the guess state (the Iteration 4 extension)
